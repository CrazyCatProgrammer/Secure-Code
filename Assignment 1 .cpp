/* Assignment #1 (pre-test) code
* Started 1/31/2019
* 
* Team members: David Bonney,
*
* Directions:
*
* Develop the design and code for each of the following programs
*
*   Program #1
*     Write a program that generates a sequence of twenty random values between 0 and 99 in an array. Print the sequence, sort the array, and print the sorted sequence.
*
*   Program #2
*     A supermarket wants to reward its best customer of each day, showing the customer’s name on a screen in the supermarket.
*     For that purpose, the customers’ purchase amount is stored in an array and the customer’s name is stored
*     in a corresponding array.
*     Write a program that prompts the cashier to enter all prices and names, then adds them to two arrays,
*     calls the function that you implemented, and displays the result. Use a price of 0 as a sentinel.
*
* Each program should include COMMENTS (internal), and a structured (functions).
* Each function should indicate who completed the design and code, or sections of the code.
*
* Modify each of the programs to include an example  the following:
*   Mitigation strategies for strings and string handling
*   String handling functions
*   Dynamic Allocation functions
*   Runtime Protection Strategies
*   Stack Canaries
*   Null Pointers
*   Allocation Functions
*
* Version number 1.00

* Program 1: Carson, Bonnie
* Program 2: Robyn, David, Paul
